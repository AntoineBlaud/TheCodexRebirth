# CodexRebirth : A Taint Analysis Approach to Reverse Engineering


## Introduction

The CodexRebirth project seeks to revolutionize the process of reverse engineering by introducing a Taint Analysis approach specifically designed to simplify the unraveling of **obfuscated methods**. This method involves a comprehensive examination of all assembly instructions, tainting every memory address and register in the process. Subsequently, when an instruction relies on a tainted register, memory, or a result derived from these tainted elements, it will execute the operation and update the associated equations. This approach enables the user to easily trace the progression of equations and values, pinpointing the instruction responsible for any value change. Furthermore, the ability to color-code instructions based on their 'taint_id' or 'block similarity' adds an additional layer of clarity to the analysis.

With the assistance of the IDA plugin, program segments are seamlessly mapped into qiling, providing an exact replica of the program in memory. Additionally, the plugin automatically configures registers and memory to their initial values at the start of the function being analyzed, streamlining the reverse engineering process.

## INSTALLATION

**Note: For IDA plugin, you need to have at least python 3.8 installed and IDA must be configured to use it.**

- After python 3.8 is installed, you need run idapyswitch to python 3.8.10, then install setuptools and wheel.
- After that, you can install the CodexRebirth plugin by using python 3.8.10 binary full path (ex: *C:\Users\antoi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe*)

Edit configuration template file *codexrebirth_config.json.template*, set rootfs path to your qiling rootfs path (ex: *C:/your_path/qiling/rootfs\*), and rename it to *codexrebirth_config.json*.

Command line installation for the CodexRebirth library:
```bash
python-ida=C:\Users\antoi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe
git clone git@github.com:AntoineBlaud/TheCodexRebirth.git
cd TheCodexRebirth/src
python-ida setup.py sdist bdist_wheel 
python-ida -pip install . 
```
Then copy config file *codexrebirth_config.json* and *src/ida_codexrebirth.py* and to your IDA plugins folder (ex: *C:\Program Files\IDA 7.6\plugins*)


## Basic Usage

- Open the IDA database of the program to analyze.
- Start debugging mode and stop the execution of the program at the beginning of the function to analyze.
- Specify an optional end address for the analysis or modify the default timeout value configured in the CodexRebirth settings
- Open the CodexRebirth context menu and select *Run Symbolic Execution*.
- Wait for the analysis to finish.
- Explore by using mouse wheel while hovering the timeline, or by using previous/next buttons or shortcuts.

## Advanced Usage Insights

- The advanced features of CodexRebirth introduce a powerful capability known as "synchronize variable." This feature enables the synchronization of stack and heap variables with registers, simplifying the task of tracking assembly variables. 

    For instance, consider the following assembly code snippet:

    ```asm
    mov     rax, [rbp+var_1D0]
    mov     eax, [rax]
    ```

    Through CodexRebirth's advanced usage, this code transformation occurs:

    ```asm
    rax_var_1D0 = rax       ; rax = rax_var_1D0
    mov     rax_var_1D0, [rbp+var_1D0]
    mov     eax, [rax_var_1D0]
    ```

    By employing this synchronization feature, CodexRebirth significantly enhances your ability to manage and understand assembly variables, making the reverse engineering process more efficient and intuitive.

- CodexRebirth further enhances the reverse engineering experience by providing a feature that allows users to navigate from a specific instruction to its subsequent or preceding occurrences. This capability facilitates a quick and insightful understanding of an instruction's purpose and functionality.



## Key Usage Considerations

- It's important to note that CodexRebirth currently only implements a partial set of instructions. You are encouraged to contribute by creating an issue or a pull request to expand this list.

- While the analysis of operations is robust, it may not be flawless. For debugging and verification purposes, CodexRebirth provides a valuable parameter: **Symbolic Check Configuration:**. When enabled (set to True), this feature cross-checks the results produced by the Symbolic Engine against those generated by Qiling. If any disparities are detected, the relevant instruction will be highlighted in red within the trace view.

## Performance Insights

The execution speed of CodexRebirth typically ranges between 200 and 1000 instructions per second. However, it's important to note that enabling the symbolic_check parameter can significantly impact performance. It's recommended to disable this feature if achieving a precise equation result is not your primary concern.

Furthermore, it's worth considering that the choice between running Windows or Linux binaries can influence the performance, and Qiling's loading time on Windows systems is notably slower, which will extend the analysis initiation process.
